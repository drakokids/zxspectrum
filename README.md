Remember the Old ZxSpectrum 48K ?

So, you probably have my age and are looking for old code just to remember or even to play.

There are many emulators out there, and this is not an emulator project.

The aim of this project is just to keep some old code saved and possibly could help someone to remember how code was made around 1986.

If you like retro games, you will also like the games in our BigTabletGames.com website. Soon you will enjoy for free simple games like the old times but running in windows, android or other os's.
